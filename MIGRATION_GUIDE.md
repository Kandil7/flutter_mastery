# Migration Guide: flutter_mastery to FlutterMastery

This guide explains the changes made to the project structure and organization to improve the learning experience.

## Project Renaming

The project has been renamed from "flutter_mastery" to "FlutterMastery" to better reflect its purpose as a comprehensive Flutter learning resource.

### Changes Made:

1. Updated `pubspec.yaml` with the new name and description
2. Updated Android package name from `com.learningbloc.flutter_mastery` to `com.fluttermastery.app`
3. Updated import statements to use the new package name
4. Updated app title and branding

## Project Structure Reorganization

The project structure has been reorganized to follow clean architecture principles and provide a clear learning path.

### New Structure:

```
lib/
├── core/                           # Core utilities and shared components
│   ├── config/                     # App configuration
│   ├── constants/                  # Constants used throughout the app
│   ├── error/                      # Error handling
│   ├── network/                    # Network utilities
│   ├── theme/                      # App theming
│   ├── utils/                      # Utility functions
│   └── widgets/                    # Shared widgets
│
├── features/                       # Feature modules organized by learning path
│   ├── 1_fundamentals/             # Beginner level concepts
│   ├── 2_state_management/         # Intermediate level - State Management
│   ├── 3_architecture/             # Advanced level - Architecture
│   ├── 4_design_patterns/          # Design Patterns in Flutter
│   └── 5_real_world/               # Real-world applications
│
├── localization/                   # Localization resources
│   ├── app_localizations.dart
│   └── languages/
│
└── main.dart                       # Application entry point
```

## Content Organization

The content has been organized into a progressive learning path:

1. **Fundamentals**: Basic Flutter concepts and simple state management
2. **State Management**: Deep dive into BLoC pattern and state management
3. **Architecture**: Advanced architectural patterns and clean architecture
4. **Design Patterns**: Common design patterns implemented in Flutter
5. **Real-World Applications**: Complete applications demonstrating all concepts

## Documentation Enhancements

Documentation has been improved throughout the project:

1. Added detailed README files for each section
2. Improved code comments to explain concepts
3. Added theoretical explanations alongside practical examples
4. Created a comprehensive project structure document

## How to Migrate Your Code

If you have made changes to the original project, follow these steps to migrate your code:

1. **Identify Your Changes**: Make a list of the files you have modified
2. **Create Feature Modules**: Create appropriate feature modules in the new structure
3. **Move Your Code**: Move your modified files to the appropriate feature modules
4. **Update Imports**: Update import statements to use the new package name
5. **Test Your Changes**: Run the app to ensure everything works as expected

## Example Migration

### Original Structure:
```
lib/
├── bloc_learning/
│   ├── examples/
│   │   └── counter_example/
│   │       ├── counter_bloc.dart
│   │       └── counter_example_screen.dart
│   └── theory/
│       └── bloc_theory.dart
└── main.dart
```

### New Structure:
```
lib/
├── features/
│   ├── 1_fundamentals/
│   │   └── counter_app/
│   │       ├── presentation/
│   │       │   ├── bloc/
│   │       │   │   ├── counter_bloc.dart
│   │       │   │   ├── counter_event.dart
│   │       │   │   └── counter_state.dart
│   │       │   ├── pages/
│   │       │   │   └── counter_page.dart
│   │       │   └── widgets/
│   │       │       └── counter_display.dart
│   │       └── README.md
│   └── 2_state_management/
│       └── bloc_basics/
│           ├── presentation/
│           │   ├── pages/
│           │   │   └── bloc_basics_page.dart
│           │   └── widgets/
│           │       └── bloc_explanation.dart
│           └── README.md
└── main.dart
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Clear Learning Path**: The new structure provides a clear learning path from basic to advanced concepts
2. **Clean Architecture**: The project now follows clean architecture principles
3. **Better Organization**: Related code is grouped together in feature modules
4. **Improved Documentation**: Each section has detailed documentation explaining the concepts
5. **Scalability**: The new structure is more scalable and can accommodate new features easily
