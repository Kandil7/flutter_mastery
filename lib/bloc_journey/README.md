# Flutter BLoC Learning Journey

This directory contains a step-by-step guide to learning the BLoC pattern in Flutter, from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## Structure

The learning journey is organized into three main sections:

### 1. Basics
- Introduction to BLoC pattern
- Understanding Cubit (simplified BLoC)
- Simple Counter example with Cubit
- BLoC vs Cubit comparison
- BLoC Observer for debugging

### 2. Intermediate
- Form validation with BLoC
- Navigation with BLoC
- BLoC-to-BLoC communication
- Error handling and loading states
- Testing BLoCs and Cubits

### 3. Advanced
- Complex state management
- BLoC with Clean Architecture
- BLoC with Dependency Injection
- Advanced BLoC patterns
- Performance optimization

## How to Use This Guide

Each section contains practical examples with detailed comments and documentation. Follow the examples in order, as each builds upon the concepts introduced in the previous ones.

The code is organized to demonstrate best practices and patterns for using BLoC in real-world applications.

## Git Workflow

Each step in the learning journey is committed separately, allowing you to track the progression and changes made at each stage. The commits follow a structured naming convention:

```
[Section] Step Description
```

For example:
```
[Basics] Add Counter Cubit implementation
[Intermediate] Implement form validation with BLoC
[Advanced] Integrate Clean Architecture with BLoC
```

This allows you to easily navigate through the history and understand the progression of the learning journey.
