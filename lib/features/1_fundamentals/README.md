### 4. Counter App

A simple counter application that demonstrates:
- Basic app structure
- Stateful widgets
- Event handling
- Simple state management

## Key Concepts

### Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of Flutter applications. Everything in Flutter is a widget, from buttons and text to layouts and animations.

```dart
// Example of a simple widget
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Text('Hello, Flutter!'),
    );
  }
}
```

### State Management

State management is a crucial concept in Flutter. It determines how your application's data changes over time and how the UI reacts to those changes.

```dart
// Example of a stateful widget
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _CounterWidgetState createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```
