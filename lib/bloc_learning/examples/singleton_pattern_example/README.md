# Singleton Pattern Example

## Overview

This example demonstrates the implementation of the Singleton Pattern in a Flutter application. The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance throughout the application lifecycle.

## Key Components

### 1. ThemeManager Singleton

The `ThemeManager` class implements the Singleton pattern:

```dart
class ThemeManager {
  // Private static instance variable
  static ThemeManager? _instance;
  
  // Private constructor
  ThemeManager._();
  
  // Factory constructor that returns the singleton instance
  factory ThemeManager() {
    // Create the instance if it doesn't exist
    _instance ??= ThemeManager._();
    return _instance!;
  }
  
  // Rest of the class implementation...
}
```

### 2. Implementation Details

The Singleton pattern is implemented using:

- **Private Constructor**: Prevents direct instantiation with the `new` keyword
- **Static Instance**: Holds the single instance of the class
- **Factory Constructor**: Controls access to the instance

### 3. UI Implementation

The `ThemeScreen` demonstrates how to use the Singleton pattern by accessing the same `ThemeManager` instance from different parts of the application.

## Benefits of Singleton Pattern

1. **Single Instance**: Ensures only one instance exists throughout the application
2. **Global Access**: Provides a global point of access to the instance
3. **Lazy Initialization**: Instance is created only when needed
4. **State Persistence**: Maintains state across the entire application

## When to Use

Use the Singleton Pattern when:

- Exactly one instance of a class is needed
- The instance needs to be accessible from many different parts of the code
- You need to control how and when the instance is created
- You want to avoid global variables but need global state

## Common Use Cases in Flutter

1. **Theme Management**: Managing application themes
2. **Configuration Management**: Storing app-wide configuration
3. **Caching**: Implementing caches that need to be accessed globally
4. **Service Locators**: Providing access to services throughout the app
5. **State Management**: Managing global application state

## Considerations

1. **Testing**: Singletons can make unit testing more difficult
2. **Concurrency**: Be careful with multithreaded applications
3. **Dependency Injection**: Consider using DI frameworks for better testability
4. **Memory Management**: Singletons persist for the entire application lifecycle

## Alternatives

1. **Dependency Injection**: More flexible and testable
2. **Service Locator Pattern**: Similar but with more flexibility
3. **Provider/BLoC**: Flutter-specific state management solutions

## Implementation in Flutter Context

In Flutter, the Singleton Pattern is particularly useful for:

1. **Theme Management**: Managing application themes (as demonstrated)
2. **Navigation Services**: Managing navigation across the app
3. **API Clients**: Creating single instances of API clients
4. **Local Storage**: Managing access to shared preferences or databases
