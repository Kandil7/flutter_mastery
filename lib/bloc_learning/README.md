# BLoC Pattern Learning Guide

This module provides comprehensive learning resources and examples for mastering the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern in Flutter applications.

## What is BLoC Pattern?

BLoC is a design pattern created by Google to separate business logic from UI components. It helps in managing state in Flutter applications in a predictable way by using streams of events and states.

## Learning Path

The learning dashboard provides a structured path to master BLoC pattern:

### 1. BLoC Theory
- Core concepts and architecture
- BLoC vs Cubit
- Advantages of BLoC pattern
- Implementation steps
- Best practices

### 2. Basic Examples
- **Counter Example**: Simple counter implementation using BLoC
- **State Management**: Learn different states and transitions in BLoC

### 3. Intermediate Examples
- **Form Validation**: Implement form validation using BLoC pattern
- **Stream Example**: Working with streams in BLoC pattern

### 4. Advanced Examples
- **Repository Pattern**: Implementing repository pattern with BLoC

### 5. Real-World Examples
- **Posts App**: Fetching and displaying posts from API using BLoC
- **Todos App**: Todo list management using BLoC pattern
- **Connectivity App**: Monitor network connectivity using BLoC

## Design Patterns Used

These examples demonstrate several important design patterns:

1. **BLoC Pattern**: Separation of business logic from UI
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data sources
3. **Factory Pattern**: Creating objects without specifying exact class
4. **Observer Pattern**: Reactive UI updates based on state changes
5. **Dependency Injection**: Providing dependencies to BLoCs

## Best Practices

- Keep BLoCs focused on specific features
- Use repositories to abstract data sources
- Create meaningful event and state classes
- Handle errors within the BLoC
- Use BlocObserver for logging and analytics
- Consider using Freezed for immutable state classes
